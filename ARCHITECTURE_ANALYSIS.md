# Architecture Analysis

## Overview
Jarvis Bot follows a modular, event‑driven architecture suited for the Cloudflare Workers runtime. Core services are registered in a lightweight dependency injection container, domain logic lives in pluggable modules, and an HTTP router exposes API endpoints and webhooks.

## Core Components
### Service Registry and Dependency Container
A custom registry maps string tokens to factory functions and controls service lifetimes (singleton, scoped, transient). The `DependencyContainer` resolves services and supports scoping for request‑level isolation.

### Event Bus
A publish/subscribe bus coordinates domain events. Handlers are invoked sequentially to preserve order and middleware adds features like correlation IDs and timing metrics.

### Module System
Domain behaviour is packaged into classes derived from `BaseDomainModule`. `ModuleManager` handles module registration, initialization, startup and teardown, enabling clean separation of concerns.

### API Layer
`ApiRouter` registers routes, middleware and default endpoints for health checks, webhooks and voice‑note synchronisation. It performs explicit API key checks before accessing module functionality.

### Scheduler
`SchedulerManager` stores cron‑based tasks and emits domain events when schedules fire, letting modules react without tight coupling.

### Logging & Error Handling
A structured logger supports multiple levels, child loggers and optional buffering. An error handler service centralises error processing and reporting.

## Domain Modules
- **AudioProcessingModule** – transcribes audio, classifies intent and routes results to tasks, notes, fund commands or questions.
- **NotesModule** – persists notes and voice notes, providing retrieval and sync features for external tools.
- **PortfolioModule** – tracks stock portfolios and produces formatted reports.
- **FundManagementModule** – parses fund‑related commands and manages positions.

## Opportunities for Enhancement
1. **Router modularisation** – split `ApiRouter` into domain‑specific routers or adopt a routing library to reduce complexity.
2. **Stronger typing for events** – replace string event identifiers with discriminated unions or enums for compile‑time safety.
3. **Automatic dependency injection** – the existing `Injectable`/`Inject` decorators could be leveraged for metadata‑driven service registration.
4. **Module discovery** – allow `ModuleManager` to load modules based on configuration and support inter‑module dependencies via the unused topological sort.
5. **Concurrency controls** – the event bus processes handlers sequentially; optional parallel processing or queues could improve throughput.
6. **Consistent error handling** – unify API error responses and propagate domain‑specific error codes.
7. **Refactor large modules** – break monolithic modules (e.g., `NotesModule`, `AudioProcessingModule`) into smaller services to improve testability.
8. **Legacy cleanup** – retire or migrate the `src/legacy` directory to reduce maintenance overhead.
9. **Configuration management** – centralise environment configuration and validate with schemas to avoid scattered defaults.
10. **Testing and observability** – expand integration tests and expose metrics/log shipping for easier monitoring.

## Conclusion
The current architecture establishes clear boundaries between infrastructure services and domain modules. Implementing the enhancements above would simplify maintenance, increase type safety and prepare the project for future growth.
